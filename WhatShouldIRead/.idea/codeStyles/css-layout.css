//Are classes designed appropriately?  Are there any super large classes or methods that should be broken into several other classes or methods?  Specifically, which ones?
  Are the UI and other layers appropriately separate?  Do you see Toasts from non-UI layers?  Do you see business logic or data access in the UI layers?
  Are Exceptions properly handled, or are there empty catches and exceptions that get buried?
